$$
R_o = {R_f \over B}
$$

If the current gain ($$B$$) were say, 1000, then with $$R_f$$=470 Ohms, the output impedance would be a reasonable 0.47 Ohms. It has to be admitted that this does not represent a very large damping factor. However, damping factor is a parameter which looks good in a specification sheet, but which has little objective reality. Consider that in a realistic situation, the output impedance is in series with the DC resistance of the voice-coil, which is likely to be about 6 Ohms, and also in series with the impedance of the cable, not to mention any crossover components. Although such a low value of $$R_f$$ represents a near approach to a voltage amplifier, by using larger values of $$R_f$$, other values of output impedance can be obtained, including almost infinity (i.e. pure current-drive).
