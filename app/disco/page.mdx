# Discographer

_*Discographer - An Automated Disc-Jockey*_ is a client/server application which plays music in a continuous fashion from WAV files stored on the server filesystem. It is designed to run on low-powered Linux devices such as Raspberry Pis. It was originally developed for use in party situations to make it easier for the DJ to search for and cue up tracks in a dimly lit environment, but is also well equipped to run on "autopilot" as a home jukebox server.
