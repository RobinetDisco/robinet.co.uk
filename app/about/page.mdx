My name is John Howard, and I am a retired electronics engineer. After graduating from university, I was employed in the
communications industry, joining the design team working on Europe's first electronic telephone exchange at
Ambergate, Derbyshire. Later, I worked on computer design, both hardware and software. I have also been
involved in the design of integrated circuits at chip level, and latterly, PCB design automation.

Since retirement, I have been pursuing a life-long
interest in music and audio, which began back in the days when the only available technology was valves, and the
only software was 78 RPM records.
